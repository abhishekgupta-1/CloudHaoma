\fBidleconn \fP- tool for opening any number of idle connections

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBidleconn\fP is part of httperf suite and is useful to simulate a large number
of concurrent and idle connections. It can establish a set of persistent
connections, each of which generated periodic requests to the server. The
effect is that at all times, some of the connections were active while the
rest were idle, and these active and idle connection sets kept changing with
time. (This paragraph was extracted and adapted from the article "Scalability
of Linux Event-Dispatch Mechanisms" (HPL-2000-174), written by Abhishek
Chandra and David Mosberger).

.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ ./idleconn 192.168.1.1 80 100

.fam T
.fi
It would open and maintain 100 idle connections to a web server, listening on
port 80, using the IP address 192.168.1.1.
